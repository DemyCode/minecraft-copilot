# Minecraft Copilot

Minecraft Copilot is an AI companion in game that solves the construction you are doing for you in a live fashion.
Minecraft Copilot is an open source project from the Minecraft code to the data used for training the artificial intelligence.

Future goals are to have a full on Stable Diffusion 3D run in game to even create structures from prompts for you !
If you want to help you can try one of those things :
- Install the project and use it
- Share the project to your friends and families
- Contribute to the codebase : https://github.com/users/DemyCode/projects/5

## Try it !

Just check the Releases panel on the right and download the latest release. (TBD later)
